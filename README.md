## Introduction

This website was built from scratch using Next.js and was first initialized in June 2023. It will undergo regular updates and serve as both a valuable learning resource and a platform for me to share my knowledge.
<br /><br />

## Features

On this website there are several features that will continue to be updated and added in the future.

### - Blogs

The CMS Blog on this website utilizes the API from the dev.to platform. The displayed articles are one-to-one with the articles published on my dev.to blog and are updated in real-time.

The data fetching technique used to retrieve articles from dev.to involves using Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for the blog list and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the blog details.
